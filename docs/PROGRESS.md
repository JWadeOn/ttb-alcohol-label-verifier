# Progress (living)

Short **human index** of where the prototype stands. **Git history** remains the audit trail; **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** stays the technical “what exists now.” Update this file when focus or shipped scope changes meaningfully.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-11

## Current focus

Phase 1 **core path** is shipped and **Day 1 closeout is committed** (Docker + fixtures + eval scaffold + docs). Emphasis now: **Render deploy smoke**, **Day 3 eval / polish** (`docs/DAY3_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md`), and **§16 acceptance** in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

---

## Done recently

- **Phase 1 pipeline** — verify API, extraction with timeout failover to `unavailable` placeholder, validator, tests (`741ce0d`).
- **UI/UX** — light theme, workbench (label + application), formatted vs JSON application editor, results with label + field comparison + raw JSON (`fd759d6`).
- **Docs** — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/modules/*`, README / AGENTS pointers; dev script and `.next` troubleshooting in README.
- **Sample asset** — `fixtures/labels/liquor_label_happy_path.png` for manual runs (`9a4c108`).
- **Day 1 closeout (committed `2fd9bb5`)** — production **`Dockerfile`** + **`.dockerignore`**, `next.config` **`output: "standalone"`**, `public/.gitkeep`; **`fixtures/`** manifest + default application JSON + nine **`seed-texture-*.png`** + **`scripts/generate-fixture-pngs.mjs`**; **`evals/run-primary-latency.mjs`** + npm script; **`docs/POC1_FALLBACK.md`**; Vitest **`fixtures-manifest`**; ESLint ignores for `scripts/**` and `evals/**`; **`pnpm-lock.yaml`** removed from workflow and **ignored**.
- **Repo hygiene (`edcaed0`)** — ignore stray **`docs/docs.code-workspace`** so local IDE files do not clutter `git status`.
- **Docker / npm-in-image stability** — `npm ci` tuned for flaky registry (parallelism + cache mount) so **`docker build`** (including **`--no-cache`**) succeeds on OrbStack when the network is healthy.
- **Verify observability & dev controls (`b479e3c`)** — structured logs for **`[extractWithFailover]`**, **`[verify-pipeline]`**, **`[verify]`** (incl. **`pipelineMs`**, **`totalMs`**, timeouts); env **`VERIFY_EXTRACT_SOFT_TIMEOUT_MS`** / **`VERIFY_EXTRACT_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS`** for local perf experiments; **`OPENAI_DISABLED`** to skip OpenAI while keeping a key; README **credits / usage** section; tests for **`OPENAI_DISABLED`**.

## Next (ordered)

1. **Render:** push image, configure secrets, capture public URL; paste smoke results into README / here.
2. Run **Day 3** items: fuller eval pass on `liquor_label_happy_path` + notes, **fallback go/no-go** when Tesseract exists (`docs/DAY3_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md`).
3. **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §16** — check off acceptance lines when the deliverable is intentionally signed off.
4. Optional: Day 3 **UX polish** block (manual-review / provider / image-quality messaging) if anything still feels unclear in a fresh walkthrough.

## Blockers

None recorded in-repo. Add a dated bullet here when something external (keys, platform, fixtures) stalls work.
